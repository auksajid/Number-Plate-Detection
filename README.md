Number Plate Detection using Enhanced YOLOv10n &amp; CNN

Implementing a license plate recognition system using PyTorch. The code is divided into two main parts:

Part 1: YOLOv10 Object Detection Model

This part defines a custom object detection model called YOLOv10, likely inspired by the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of object detectors.

Feature Extraction:

It uses a backbone network (not explicitly defined in the provided code) to extract features from the input image.
A neck network, likely a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), further processes these features to create multi-scale feature maps.
BiFPN, SEAM, and GCNet modules are used for feature refinement and enhancement within the neck.
Object Detection:

The head of the network takes the refined features and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects in the image (license plates).

Part 2: Character Recognition CNN

This part focuses on recognizing individual characters within a detected license plate.

CNN Model:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CharacterRecognitionCNN) is defined for character recognition.
It consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features and classify characters.
Model Loading and Preprocessing:

A pre-trained character recognition model is loaded from a file (character_recognition_model.pth).
An image preprocessing pipeline (transform) is defined to convert character images to the format expected by the CNN model.
Character Recognition:

The recognize_character function takes a character image as input, preprocesses it, and passes it through the CNN model to predict the character.
License Plate Recognition:

A loop iterates through a list of detected characters (presumably obtained from the YOLOv10 model).
For each character, it loads the corresponding image, recognizes the character using the recognize_character function, and appends it to the recognized_plate string.
Output:

Finally, the recognized license plate string is printed.

In summary, the code defines a two-stage license plate recognition system:

Object Detection: YOLOv10 model detects license plates in an image.
Character Recognition: A CNN model recognizes individual characters within the detected license plates.
The recognized characters are then combined to form the final license plate string.
